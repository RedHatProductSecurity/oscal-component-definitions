# sc-8 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity

## Control Statement

Protect the {{ insert: param, sc-08_odp }} of transmitted information.

- \[sc-8_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

the {{ insert: param, sc-08_odp }} of transmitted information is/are protected.

## Control guidance

For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8 (1), physical means as specified in SC-8 (5), or in combination.



For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:

*  Crossing the system boundary
*  Between compute instances - including containers
*  From a compute instance to storage
*  Replication between availability zones
*  Transmission of backups to storage
*  From a load balancer to a compute instance
*  Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.




The following applies only when choosing SC-8 (5) in lieu of SC-8 (1).

FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters

SC-8 (5)-1 [a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)]

SC-8 (5)-2 [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information]
SC-8 (5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.



Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA).



Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2 (1), PE-2 (2), PE-2 (3), PE-3 (2), PE-3 (3), PE-6 (2), and PE-6 (3).



Note: When selecting SC-8 (5), the above SC-8(5), and the above referenced PE controls must be added to the SSP.

Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information applies to internal and external networks as well as any system components that can transmit information, including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and radios. Unprotected communication paths are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information can be accomplished by physical or logical means. Physical protection can be achieved by using protected distribution systems. A protected distribution system is a wireline or fiber-optics telecommunications system that includes terminals and adequate electromagnetic, acoustical, electrical, and physical controls to permit its use for the unencrypted transmission of classified information. Logical protection can be achieved by employing encryption techniques.

Organizations that rely on commercial providers who offer transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed controls for transmission confidentiality and integrity. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality or integrity services are available in standard, commercial telecommunications service packages. If it is not feasible to obtain the necessary controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations can implement appropriate compensating controls.
