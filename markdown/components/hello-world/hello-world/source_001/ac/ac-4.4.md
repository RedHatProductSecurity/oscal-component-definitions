# ac-4.4 - \[Access Control\] Flow Control of Encrypted Information

## Control Statement

Prevent encrypted information from bypassing {{ insert: param, ac-04.04_odp.01 }} by {{ insert: param, ac-04.04_odp.02 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

encrypted information is prevented from bypassing {{ insert: param, ac-04.04_odp.01 }} by {{ insert: param, ac-04.04_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Flow control mechanisms include content checking, security policy filters, and data type identifiers. The term encryption is extended to cover encoded data not recognized by filtering mechanisms.
