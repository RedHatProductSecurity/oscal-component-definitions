# sa-17 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Developer Security and Privacy Architecture and Design

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to produce a design specification and security and privacy architecture that:

- \[a.\] Is consistent with the organization’s security and privacy architecture that is an integral part the organization’s enterprise architecture;

- \[b.\] Accurately and completely describes the required security and privacy functionality, and the allocation of controls among physical and logical components; and

- \[c.\] Expresses how individual security and privacy functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security and privacy capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-17(a)\]

  - \[SA-17(a)[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce a design specification and security architecture that are consistent with the organization’s security architecture, which is an integral part the organization’s enterprise architecture;
  - \[SA-17(a)[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce a design specification and privacy architecture that are consistent with the organization’s privacy architecture, which is an integral part the organization’s enterprise architecture;

- \[SA-17(b)\]

  - \[SA-17(b)[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce a design specification and security architecture that accurately and completely describe the required security functionality and the allocation of controls among physical and logical components;
  - \[SA-17(b)[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce a design specification and privacy architecture that accurately and completely describe the required privacy functionality and the allocation of controls among physical and logical components;

- \[SA-17(c)\]

  - \[SA-17(c)[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce a design specification and security architecture that express how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection;
  - \[SA-17(c)[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce a design specification and privacy architecture that express how individual privacy functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required privacy capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

## Control guidance

Developer security and privacy architecture and design are directed at external developers, although they could also be applied to internal (in-house) development. In contrast, [PL-8](#pl-8) is directed at internal developers to ensure that organizations develop a security and privacy architecture that is integrated with the enterprise architecture. The distinction between SA-17 and [PL-8](#pl-8) is especially important when organizations outsource the development of systems, system components, or system services and when there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with the enterprise architecture and security and privacy architecture of the organization. [ISO 15408-2](#87087451-2af5-43d4-88c1-d66ad850f614), [ISO 15408-3](#4452efc0-e79e-47b8-aa30-b54f3ef61c2f) , and [SP 800-160-1](#e3cc0520-a366-4fc9-abc2-5272db7e3564) provide information on security architecture and design, including formal policy models, security-relevant components, formal and informal correspondence, conceptually simple design, and structuring for least privilege and testing.
