# cp-9.5 - \[Contingency Planning\] Transfer to Alternate Storage Site

## Control Statement

Transfer system backup information to the alternate storage site {{ insert: param, cp-9.5_prm_1 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CP-09(05)[02]\] system backup information is transferred to the alternate storage site {{ insert: param, cp-09.05_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

System backup information can be transferred to alternate storage sites either electronically or by the physical shipment of storage media.
