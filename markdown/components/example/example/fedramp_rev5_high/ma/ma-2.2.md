# ma-2.2 - \[Maintenance\] Automated Maintenance Activities

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Schedule, conduct, and document maintenance, repair, and replacement actions for the system using {{ insert: param, ma-2.2_prm_1 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Produce up-to date, accurate, and complete records of all maintenance, repair, and replacement actions requested, scheduled, in process, and completed.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[MA-02(02)(a)\]

  - \[MA-02(02)(a)[01]\] {{ insert: param, ma-02.02_odp.01 }} are used to schedule maintenance, repair, and replacement actions for the system;
  - \[MA-02(02)(a)[02]\] {{ insert: param, ma-02.02_odp.02 }} are used to conduct maintenance, repair, and replacement actions for the system;
  - \[MA-02(02)(a)[03]\] {{ insert: param, ma-02.02_odp.03 }} are used to document maintenance, repair, and replacement actions for the system;

- \[MA-02(02)(b)\]

  - \[MA-02(02)(b)[01]\] up-to date, accurate, and complete records of all maintenance actions requested, scheduled, in process, and completed are produced.
  - \[MA-02(02)(b)[02]\] up-to date, accurate, and complete records of all repair actions requested, scheduled, in process, and completed are produced.
  - \[MA-02(02)(b)[03]\] up-to date, accurate, and complete records of all replacement actions requested, scheduled, in process, and completed are produced.

## Control guidance

The use of automated mechanisms to manage and control system maintenance programs and activities helps to ensure the generation of timely, accurate, complete, and consistent maintenance records.
