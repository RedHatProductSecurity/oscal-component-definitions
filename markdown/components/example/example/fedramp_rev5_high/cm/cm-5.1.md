# cm-5.1 - \[Configuration Management\] Automated Access Enforcement and Audit Records

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Enforce access restrictions using {{ insert: param, cm-05.01_odp }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Automatically generate audit records of the enforcement actions.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CM-05(01)(a)\] access restrictions for change are enforced using {{ insert: param, cm-05.01_odp }};

- \[CM-05(01)(b)\] audit records of enforcement actions are automatically generated.

## Control guidance

Organizations log system accesses associated with applying configuration changes to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes.
