# ac-18.4 - \[Access Control\] Restrict Configurations by Users

## Control Statement

Identify and explicitly authorize users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-18(04)[01]\] users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities are identified;

- \[AC-18(04)[02]\] users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities are explicitly authorized.

## Control guidance

Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure wireless networking capabilities are enforced, in part, by the access enforcement mechanisms employed within organizational systems.
