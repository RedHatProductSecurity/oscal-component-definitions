# ac-2.5 - \[Access Control\] Inactivity Logout

## Control Statement

Require that users log out when {{ insert: param, ac-02.05_odp }}.

- \[5_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

users are required to log out when {{ insert: param, ac-02.05_odp }}.

## Control guidance

Should use a shorter timeframe than AC-12.

Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. Automatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by [AC-11](#ac-11).
