# pe-12 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Emergency Lighting

## Control Statement

Employ and maintain automatic emergency lighting for the system that activates in the event of a power outage or disruption and that covers emergency exits and evacuation routes within the facility.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-12[01]\] automatic emergency lighting that activates in the event of a power outage or disruption is employed for the system;

- \[PE-12[02]\] automatic emergency lighting that activates in the event of a power outage or disruption is maintained for the system;

- \[PE-12[03]\] automatic emergency lighting for the system covers emergency exits within the facility;

- \[PE-12[04]\] automatic emergency lighting for the system covers evacuation routes within the facility.

## Control guidance

The provision of emergency lighting applies primarily to organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Emergency lighting provisions for the system are described in the contingency plan for the organization. If emergency lighting for the system fails or cannot be provided, organizations consider alternate processing sites for power-related contingencies.
