# pe-11 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Emergency Power

## Control Statement

Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate {{ insert: param, pe-11_odp }} in the event of a primary power source loss.

## Control Assessment Objective

an uninterruptible power supply is provided to facilitate {{ insert: param, pe-11_odp }} in the event of a primary power source loss.

## Control guidance

An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.
