# sr-9.1 - \[Supply Chain Risk Management\] Multiple Stages of System Development Life Cycle

## Control Statement

Employ anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques throughout the system development life cycle.

## Control Assessment Objective

anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques are employed throughout the system development life cycle.

## Control guidance

The system development life cycle includes research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal. Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations use obfuscation and self-checking to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. The customization of systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.
