# ia-5.7 - \[Identification and Authentication\] No Embedded Unencrypted Static Authenticators

## Control Statement

Ensure that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or other forms of static storage.

- \[7_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or other forms of static storage.

## Control guidance

In this context, prohibited static storage refers to any storage where unencrypted authenticators, such as passwords, persist beyond the time required to complete the access process.

In addition to applications, other forms of static storage include access scripts and function keys. Organizations exercise caution when determining whether embedded or stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators.
