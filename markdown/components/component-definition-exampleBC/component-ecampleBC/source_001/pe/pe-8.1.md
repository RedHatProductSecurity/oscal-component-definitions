# pe-8.1 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Automated Records Maintenance and Review

## Control Statement

Maintain and review visitor access records using {{ insert: param, pe-8.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-08(01)[01]\] visitor access records are maintained using {{ insert: param, pe-08.01_odp.01 }};

- \[PE-08(01)[02]\] visitor access records are reviewed using {{ insert: param, pe-08.01_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Visitor access records may be stored and maintained in a database management system that is accessible by organizational personnel. Automated access to such records facilitates record reviews on a regular basis to determine if access authorizations are current and still required to support organizational mission and business functions.
