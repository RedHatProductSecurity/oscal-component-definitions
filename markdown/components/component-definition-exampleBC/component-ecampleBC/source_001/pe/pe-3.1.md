# pe-3.1 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] System Access

## Control Statement

Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at {{ insert: param, pe-03.01_odp }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-03(01)[01]\] physical access authorizations to the system are enforced;

- \[PE-03(01)02]\] physical access controls are enforced for the facility at {{ insert: param, pe-03.01_odp }}.

## Control guidance

Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.
