# pe-16 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Delivery and Removal

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Authorize and control {{ insert: param, pe-16_prm_1 }} entering and exiting the facility; and

- \[b.\] Maintain records of the system components.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-16a.\]

  - \[PE-16a.[01]\] {{ insert: param, pe-16_odp.01 }} are authorized when entering the facility;
  - \[PE-16a.[02]\] {{ insert: param, pe-16_odp.01 }} are controlled when entering the facility;
  - \[PE-16a.[03]\] {{ insert: param, pe-16_odp.02 }} are authorized when exiting the facility;
  - \[PE-16a.[04]\] {{ insert: param, pe-16_odp.02 }} are controlled when exiting the facility;

- \[PE-16b.\] records of the system components are maintained.

## Control guidance

Enforcing authorizations for entry and exit of system components may require restricting access to delivery areas and isolating the areas from the system and media libraries.
