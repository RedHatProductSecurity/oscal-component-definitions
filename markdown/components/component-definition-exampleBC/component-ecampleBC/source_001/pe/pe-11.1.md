# pe-11.1 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Alternate Power Supply â€” Minimal Operational Capability

## Control Statement

Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated {{ insert: param, pe-11.01_odp }} and that can maintain minimally required operational capability in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-11(01)[01]\] an alternate power supply provided for the system is activated {{ insert: param, pe-11.01_odp }};

- \[PE-11(01)[02]\] the alternate power supply provided for the system can maintain minimally required operational capability in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

## Control guidance

Provision of an alternate power supply with minimal operating capability can be satisfied by accessing a secondary commercial power supply or other external power supply.
