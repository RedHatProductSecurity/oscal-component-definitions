# pe-18 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Location of System Components

## Control Statement

Position system components within the facility to minimize potential damage from {{ insert: param, pe-18_odp }} and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

## Control Assessment Objective

system components are positioned within the facility to minimize potential damage from {{ insert: param, pe-18_odp }} and to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access.

## Control guidance

Physical and environmental hazards include floods, fires, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorism, vandalism, an electromagnetic pulse, electrical interference, and other forms of incoming electromagnetic radiation. Organizations consider the location of entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be near systems. Such proximity can increase the risk of unauthorized access to organizational communications using wireless packet sniffers or microphones, or unauthorized disclosure of information.
