# cm-7.2 - \[Configuration Management\] Prevent Program Execution

## Control Statement

Prevent program execution in accordance with {{ insert: param, cm-07.02_odp.01 }}.

- \[2_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

program execution is prevented in accordance with {{ insert: param, cm-07.02_odp.01 }}.

## Control guidance

This control refers to software deployment by CSP personnel into the production environment. The control requires a policy that states conditions for deploying software. This control shall be implemented in a technical manner on the information system to only allow programs to run that adhere to the policy (i.e. allow-listing). This control is not to be based off of strictly written policy on what is allowed or not allowed to run.
Prevention of program execution addresses organizational policies, rules of behavior, and/or access agreements that restrict software usage and the terms and conditions imposed by the developer or manufacturer, including software licensing and copyrights. Restrictions include prohibiting auto-execute features, restricting roles allowed to approve program execution, permitting or prohibiting specific software programs, or restricting the number of program instances executed at the same time.
