# cm-14 - \[Configuration Management\] Signed Components

## Control Statement

Prevent the installation of {{ insert: param, cm-14_prm_1 }} without verification that the component has been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CM-14[01]\] the installation of {{ insert: param, cm-14_odp.01 }} is prevented unless it is verified that the software has been digitally signed using a certificate recognized and approved by the organization;

- \[CM-14[02]\] the installation of {{ insert: param, cm-14_odp.02 }} is prevented unless it is verified that the firmware has been digitally signed using a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.

## Control guidance

If digital signatures/certificates are unavailable, alternative cryptographic integrity checks (hashes, self-signed certs, etc.) can be utilized.
Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless signed with recognized and approved certificates include software and firmware version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input/output system updates. Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by specific items, or a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of such signatures is a method of code authentication.
