# cm-4.2 - \[Configuration Management\] Verification of Controls

## Control Statement

After system changes, verify that the impacted controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CM-04(02)[01]\] the impacted controls are implemented correctly with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[02]\] the impacted controls are implemented correctly with regard to meeting the privacy requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[03]\] the impacted controls are operating as intended with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[04]\] the impacted controls are operating as intended with regard to meeting the privacy requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[05]\] the impacted controls are producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[06]\] the impacted controls are producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the privacy requirements for the system after system changes.

## Control guidance

Implementation in this context refers to installing changed code in the operational system that may have an impact on security or privacy controls.
