- \[(a)\] Have valid access authorizations that are demonstrated by assigned official government duties; and

- \[(b)\] Satisfy {{ insert: param, ps-03.03_odp }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PS-03(03)(b)\] individuals accessing a system processing, storing, or transmitting information requiring special protection satisfy {{ insert: param, ps-03.03_odp }}.
