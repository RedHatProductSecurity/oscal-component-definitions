# sa-4.5 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] System, Component, and Service Configurations

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:

- \[(a)\] Deliver the system, component, or service with {{ insert: param, sa-04.05_odp }} implemented; and

- \[(b)\] Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service reinstallation or upgrade.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-04(05)(a)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to deliver the system, component, or service with {{ insert: param, sa-04.05_odp }} implemented;

- \[SA-04(05)(b)\] the configurations are used as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service reinstallation or upgrade.

## Control guidance

Examples of security configurations include the U.S. Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB), Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), and any limitations on functions, ports, protocols, and services. Security characteristics can include requiring that default passwords have been changed.
