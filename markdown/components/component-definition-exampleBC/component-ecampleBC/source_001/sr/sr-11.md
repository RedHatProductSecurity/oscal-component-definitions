# sr-11 - \[Supply Chain Risk Management\] Component Authenticity

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Develop and implement anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the system; and

- \[b.\] Report counterfeit system components to {{ insert: param, sr-11_odp.01 }}.

- \[sr-11_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] CSOs must ensure that their supply chain vendors provide authenticity of software and patches and the vendor must have a plan to protect the development pipeline.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SR-11a.\]

  - \[SR-11a.[01]\] an anti-counterfeit policy is developed and implemented;
  - \[SR-11a.[02]\] anti-counterfeit procedures are developed and implemented;
  - \[SR-11a.[03]\] the anti-counterfeit procedures include the means to detect counterfeit components entering the system;
  - \[SR-11a.[04]\] the anti-counterfeit procedures include the means to prevent counterfeit components from entering the system;

- \[SR-11b.\] counterfeit system components are reported to {{ insert: param, sr-11_odp.01 }}.

## Control guidance

Sources of counterfeit components include manufacturers, developers, vendors, and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policies and procedures support tamper resistance and provide a level of protection against the introduction of malicious code. External reporting organizations include CISA.
