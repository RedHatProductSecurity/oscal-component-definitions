# sr-9 - \[Supply Chain Risk Management\] Tamper Resistance and Detection

## Control Statement

Implement a tamper protection program for the system, system component, or system service.

- \[sr-9_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] CSOs must ensure vendors provide authenticity of software and patches supplied to the service provider including documenting the safeguards in place.

## Control Assessment Objective

a tamper protection program is implemented for the system, system component, or system service.

## Control guidance

Anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques provide a level of protection for systems, system components, and services against many threats, including reverse engineering, modification, and substitution. Strong identification combined with tamper resistance and/or tamper detection is essential to protecting systems and components during distribution and when in use.
