# au-12 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Audit Record Generation

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing as defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a) on {{ insert: param, au-12_odp.01 }};

- \[b.\] Allow {{ insert: param, au-12_odp.02 }} to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and

- \[c.\] Generate audit records for the event types defined in [AU-2c](#au-2_smt.c) that include the audit record content defined in [AU-3](#au-3).

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AU-12a.\] audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing (defined in AU-02_ODP[01]) is provided by {{ insert: param, au-12_odp.01 }};

- \[AU-12b.\] {{ insert: param, au-12_odp.02 }} is/are allowed to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system;

- \[AU-12c.\] audit records for the event types defined in AU-02_ODP[02] that include the audit record content defined in AU-03 are generated.

## Control guidance

Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event types specified in [AU-2d](#au-2_smt.d) are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.
