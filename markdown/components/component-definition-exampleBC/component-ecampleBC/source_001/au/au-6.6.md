# au-6.6 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Correlation with Physical Monitoring

## Control Statement

Correlate information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

- \[6_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] Coordination between service provider and consumer shall be documented and accepted by the JAB/AO.

## Control Assessment Objective

information from audit records is correlated with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

## Control guidance

The correlation of physical audit record information and the audit records from systems may assist organizations in identifying suspicious behavior or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individualâ€™s identity for logical access to certain systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was present at the facility when the logical access occurred may be useful in investigations.
