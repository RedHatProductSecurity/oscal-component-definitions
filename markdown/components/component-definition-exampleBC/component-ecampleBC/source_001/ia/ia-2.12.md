# ia-2.12 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Acceptance of PIV Credentials

## Control Statement

Accept and electronically verify Personal Identity Verification-compliant credentials.

- \[12_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

Personal Identity Verification-compliant credentials are accepted and electronically verified.

## Control guidance

Include Common Access Card (CAC), i.e., the DoD technical implementation of PIV/FIPS 201/HSPD-12.
Acceptance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV)-compliant credentials applies to organizations implementing logical access control and physical access control systems. PIV-compliant credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. The adequacy and reliability of PIV card issuers are authorized using [SP 800-79-2](#10963761-58fc-4b20-b3d6-b44a54daba03) . Acceptance of PIV-compliant credentials includes derived PIV credentials, the use of which is addressed in [SP 800-166](#e8552d48-cf41-40aa-8b06-f45f7fb4706c) . The DOD Common Access Card (CAC) is an example of a PIV credential.
