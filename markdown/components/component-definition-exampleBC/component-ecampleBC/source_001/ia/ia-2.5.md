# ia-2.5 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Individual Authentication with Group Authentication

## Control Statement

When shared accounts or authenticators are employed, require users to be individually authenticated before granting access to the shared accounts or resources.

## Control Assessment Objective

users are required to be individually authenticated before granting access to the shared accounts or resources when shared accounts or authenticators are employed.

## Control guidance

Individual authentication prior to shared group authentication mitigates the risk of using group accounts or authenticators.
