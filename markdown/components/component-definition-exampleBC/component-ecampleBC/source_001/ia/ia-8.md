# ia-8 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Identification and Authentication (Non-organizational Users)

## Control Statement

Uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users.

## Control Assessment Objective

non-organizational users or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users are uniquely identified and authenticated.

## Control guidance

Non-organizational users include system users other than organizational users explicitly covered by [IA-2](#ia-2) . Non-organizational users are uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses other than those explicitly identified and documented in [AC-14](#ac-14) . Identification and authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems). Organizations consider many factors—including security, privacy, scalability, and practicality—when balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk.
