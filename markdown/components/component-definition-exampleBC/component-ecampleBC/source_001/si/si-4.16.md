# si-4.16 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Correlate Monitoring Information

## Control Statement

Correlate information from monitoring tools and mechanisms employed throughout the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

information from monitoring tools and mechanisms employed throughout the system is correlated.

## Control guidance

Correlating information from different system monitoring tools and mechanisms can provide a more comprehensive view of system activity. Correlating system monitoring tools and mechanisms that typically work in isolation—including malicious code protection software, host monitoring, and network monitoring—can provide an organization-wide monitoring view and may reveal otherwise unseen attack patterns. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of diverse monitoring tools and mechanisms and how to maximize the use of information generated by those tools and mechanisms can help organizations develop, operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. The correlation of monitoring information is especially important during the transition from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).
