# si-4.20 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Privileged Users

## Control Statement

Implement the following additional monitoring of privileged users: {{ insert: param, si-04.20_odp }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

{{ insert: param, si-04.20_odp }} of privileged users is implemented.

## Control guidance

Privileged users have access to more sensitive information, including security-related information, than the general user population. Access to such information means that privileged users can potentially do greater damage to systems and organizations than non-privileged users. Therefore, implementing additional monitoring on privileged users helps to ensure that organizations can identify malicious activity at the earliest possible time and take appropriate actions.
