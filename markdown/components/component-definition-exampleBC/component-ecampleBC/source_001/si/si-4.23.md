# si-4.23 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Host-based Devices

## Control Statement

Implement the following host-based monitoring mechanisms at {{ insert: param, si-04.23_odp.02 }}: {{ insert: param, si-04.23_odp.01 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

{{ insert: param, si-04.23_odp.01 }} are implemented on {{ insert: param, si-04.23_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Host-based monitoring collects information about the host (or system in which it resides). System components in which host-based monitoring can be implemented include servers, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Organizations may consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple product developers or vendors.
