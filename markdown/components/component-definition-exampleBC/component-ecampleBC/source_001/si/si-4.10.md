# si-4.10 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Visibility of Encrypted Communications

## Control Statement

Make provisions so that {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.01 }} is visible to {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.02 }}.

- \[10_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] The service provider must support Agency requirements to comply with M-21-31 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/M-21-31-Improving-the-Federal-Governments-Investigative-and-Remediation-Capabilities-Related-to-Cybersecurity-Incidents.pdf) and M-22-09 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf).

## Control Assessment Objective

provisions are made so that {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.01 }} is visible to {{ insert: param, si-04.10_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Organizations balance the need to encrypt communications traffic to protect data confidentiality with the need to maintain visibility into such traffic from a monitoring perspective. Organizations determine whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.
