# si-4.1 - \[System and Information Integrity\] System-wide Intrusion Detection System

## Control Statement

Connect and configure individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion detection system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-04(01)[01]\] individual intrusion detection tools are connected to a system-wide intrusion detection system;

- \[SI-04(01)[02]\] individual intrusion detection tools are configured into a system-wide intrusion detection system.

## Control guidance

Linking individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion detection system provides additional coverage and effective detection capabilities. The information contained in one intrusion detection tool can be shared widely across the organization, making the system-wide detection capability more robust and powerful.
