# ra-5.11 - \[Risk Assessment\] Public Disclosure Program

## Control Statement

Establish a public reporting channel for receiving reports of vulnerabilities in organizational systems and system components.

## Control Assessment Objective

a public reporting channel is established for receiving reports of vulnerabilities in organizational systems and system components.

## Control guidance

The reporting channel is publicly discoverable and contains clear language authorizing good-faith research and the disclosure of vulnerabilities to the organization. The organization does not condition its authorization on an expectation of indefinite non-disclosure to the public by the reporting entity but may request a specific time period to properly remediate the vulnerability.
