# ma-4.3 - \[Maintenance\] Comparable Security and Sanitization

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Require that nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic services be performed from a system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the system being serviced; or

- \[(b)\] Remove the component to be serviced from the system prior to nonlocal maintenance or diagnostic services; sanitize the component (for organizational information); and after the service is performed, inspect and sanitize the component (for potentially malicious software) before reconnecting the component to the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[MA-04(03)(a)\]

  - \[MA-04(03)(a)[01]\] nonlocal maintenance services are required to be performed from a system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the system being serviced;
  - \[MA-04(03)(a)[02]\] nonlocal diagnostic services are required to be performed from a system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the system being serviced; or

- \[MA-04(03)(b)\]

  - \[MA-04(03)(b)[01]\] the component to be serviced is removed from the system prior to nonlocal maintenance or diagnostic services;
  - \[MA-04(03)(b)[02]\] the component to be serviced is sanitized (for organizational information);
  - \[MA-04(03)(b)[03]\] the component is inspected and sanitized (for potentially malicious software) after the service is performed and before reconnecting the component to the system.

## Control guidance

Comparable security capability on systems, diagnostic tools, and equipment providing maintenance services implies that the implemented controls on those systems, tools, and equipment are at least as comprehensive as the controls on the system being serviced.
