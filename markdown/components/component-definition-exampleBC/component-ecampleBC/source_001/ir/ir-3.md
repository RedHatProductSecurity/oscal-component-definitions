# ir-3 - \[Incident Response\] Incident Response Testing

## Control Statement

Test the effectiveness of the incident response capability for the system {{ insert: param, ir-03_odp.01 }} using the following tests: {{ insert: param, ir-03_odp.02 }}.

- \[ir-3_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] The service provider defines tests and/or exercises in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-61 (as amended). Functional testing must occur prior to testing for initial authorization. Annual functional testing may be concurrent with required penetration tests (see CA-8). The service provider provides test plans to the JAB/AO annually. Test plans are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO prior to test commencing.

## Control Assessment Objective

the effectiveness of the incident response capability for the system is tested {{ insert: param, ir-03_odp.01 }} using {{ insert: param, ir-03_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their effectiveness and identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, and simulations (parallel or full interrupt). Incident response testing can include a determination of the effects on organizational operations and assets and individuals due to incident response. The use of qualitative and quantitative data aids in determining the effectiveness of incident response processes.
