# ir-5.1 - \[Incident Response\] Automated Tracking, Data Collection, and Analysis

## Control Statement

Track incidents and collect and analyze incident information using {{ insert: param, ir-5.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[IR-05(01)[01]\] incidents are tracked using {{ insert: param, ir-05.01_odp.01 }};

- \[IR-05(01)[02]\] incident information is collected using {{ insert: param, ir-05.01_odp.02 }};

- \[IR-05(01)[03]\] incident information is analyzed using {{ insert: param, ir-05.01_odp.03 }}.

## Control guidance

Automated mechanisms for tracking incidents and collecting and analyzing incident information include Computer Incident Response Centers or other electronic databases of incidents and network monitoring devices.
