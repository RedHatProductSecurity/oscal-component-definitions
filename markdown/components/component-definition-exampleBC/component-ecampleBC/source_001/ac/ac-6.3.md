# ac-6.3 - \[Access Control\] Network Access to Privileged Commands

## Control Statement

Authorize network access to {{ insert: param, ac-06.03_odp.01 }} only for {{ insert: param, ac-06.03_odp.02 }} and document the rationale for such access in the security plan for the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-06(03)[01]\] network access to {{ insert: param, ac-06.03_odp.01 }} is authorized only for {{ insert: param, ac-06.03_odp.02 }};

- \[AC-06(03)[02]\] the rationale for authorizing network access to privileged commands is documented in the security plan for the system.

## Control guidance

Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of local access (i.e., user being physically present at the device).
