# ac-2.7 - \[Access Control\] Privileged User Accounts

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-02.07_odp }};

- \[(b)\] Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;

- \[(c)\] Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and

- \[(d)\] Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer appropriate.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-02(07)(a)\] privileged user accounts are established and administered in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-02.07_odp }};

- \[AC-02(07)(b)\] privileged role or attribute assignments are monitored;

- \[AC-02(07)(c)\] changes to roles or attributes are monitored;

- \[AC-02(07)(d)\] access is revoked when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer appropriate.

## Control guidance

Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key management, account management, database administration, system and network administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges based on attributes.
