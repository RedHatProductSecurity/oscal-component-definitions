# ac-18 - \[Access Control\] Wireless Access

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of wireless access; and

- \[b.\] Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-18a.\]

  - \[AC-18a.[01]\] configuration requirements are established for each type of wireless access;
  - \[AC-18a.[02]\] connection requirements are established for each type of wireless access;
  - \[AC-18a.[03]\] implementation guidance is established for each type of wireless access;

- \[AC-18b.\] each type of wireless access to the system is authorized prior to allowing such connections.

## Control guidance

Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or very high frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide authenticator protection and mutual authentication.
