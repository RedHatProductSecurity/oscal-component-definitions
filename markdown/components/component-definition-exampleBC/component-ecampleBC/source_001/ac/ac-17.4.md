# ac-17.4 - \[Access Control\] Privileged Commands and Access

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides assessable evidence and for the following needs: {{ insert: param, ac-17.4_prm_1 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Document the rationale for remote access in the security plan for the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-17(04)(a)\]

  - \[AC-17(04)(a)[01]\] the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only in a format that provides assessable evidence;
  - \[AC-17(04)(a)[02]\] access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only in a format that provides assessable evidence;
  - \[AC-17(04)(a)[03]\] the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only for the following needs: {{ insert: param, ac-17.04_odp.01 }};
  - \[AC-17(04)(a)[04]\] access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only for the following needs: {{ insert: param, ac-17.04_odp.02 }};

- \[AC-17(04)(b)\] the rationale for remote access is documented in the security plan for the system.

## Control guidance

Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and the susceptibility to threats by adversaries to the remote access capability.
