# ac-2.9 - \[Access Control\] Restrictions on Use of Shared and Group Accounts

## Control Statement

Only permit the use of shared and group accounts that meet {{ insert: param, ac-02.09_odp }}.

- \[9_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] Required if shared/group accounts are deployed.

## Control Assessment Objective

the use of shared and group accounts is only permitted if {{ insert: param, ac-02.09_odp }} are met.

## Control guidance

Before permitting the use of shared or group accounts, organizations consider the increased risk due to the lack of accountability with such accounts.
