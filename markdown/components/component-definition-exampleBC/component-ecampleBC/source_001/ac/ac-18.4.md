## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-18(04)[02]\] users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities are explicitly authorized.

## Control guidance

Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure wireless networking capabilities are enforced, in part, by the access enforcement mechanisms employed within organizational systems.
