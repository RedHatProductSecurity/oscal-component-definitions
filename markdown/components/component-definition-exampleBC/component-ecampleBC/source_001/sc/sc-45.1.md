# sc-45.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Compare the internal system clocks {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.01 }} with {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.02 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.03 }}.

- \[1_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] The service provider selects primary and secondary time servers used by the NIST Internet time service. The secondary server is selected from a different geographic region than the primary server.
  - \[Requirement:\] The service provider synchronizes the system clocks of network computers that run operating systems other than Windows to the Windows Server Domain Controller emulator or to the same time source for that server.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-45(01)(a)\] the internal system clocks are compared {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.01 }} with {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.02 }};

- \[SC-45(01)(b)\] the internal system clocks are synchronized with the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than {{ insert: param, sc-45.01_odp.03 }}.

## Control guidance

Synchronization of system clocks improves the accuracy of log analysis.
Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
