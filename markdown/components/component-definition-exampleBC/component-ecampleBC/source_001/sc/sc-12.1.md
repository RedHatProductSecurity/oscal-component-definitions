## Control Statement

Maintain availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.

## Control Assessment Objective

information availability is maintained in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.

## Control guidance

Escrowing of encryption keys is a common practice for ensuring availability in the event of key loss. A forgotten passphrase is an example of losing a cryptographic key.
