# sc-15 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Collaborative Computing Devices and Applications

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices and applications with the following exceptions: {{ insert: param, sc-15_odp }} ; and

- \[b.\] Provide an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.

- \[sc-15_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] The information system provides disablement (instead of physical disconnect) of collaborative computing devices in a manner that supports ease of use.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-15a.\] remote activation of collaborative computing devices and applications is prohibited except {{ insert: param, sc-15_odp }};

- \[SC-15b.\] an explicit indication of use is provided to users physically present at the devices.

## Control guidance

Collaborative computing devices and applications include remote meeting devices and applications, networked white boards, cameras, and microphones. The explicit indication of use includes signals to users when collaborative computing devices and applications are activated.
