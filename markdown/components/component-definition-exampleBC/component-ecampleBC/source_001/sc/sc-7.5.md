# sc-7.5 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Deny by Default â€” Allow by Exception

## Control Statement

Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception {{ insert: param, sc-07.05_odp.01 }}.

- \[5_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-07(05)[01]\] network communications traffic is denied by default {{ insert: param, sc-07.05_odp.01 }};

- \[SC-07(05)[02]\] network communications traffic is allowed by exception {{ insert: param, sc-07.05_odp.01 }}.

## Control guidance

For JAB Authorization, CSPs shall include details of this control in their Architecture Briefing
Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception also applies to a system that is connected to an external system.
